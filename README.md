# Garbage-Collector-System
It is a project made using HTML,CSS, Java Servelet and MySQL.The idea behind this project is to book an online slot or appointment to collect garbage from their house,when they are avaliable.
This slot booking can be of any place like park, community place or road, etc.Our project will work on the Municipal Corporation System so that they can get the information where the place is dirty or
any such heap of garbage in the society. I worked as front end developer to bring the rich user-friendly experience. 
   In this project we have used MYSQL as a data base server to save the data. On backend we have used Java Servelet Page to make things work. We have used forms to show the registration processing,booking and getting the feedback of people.
